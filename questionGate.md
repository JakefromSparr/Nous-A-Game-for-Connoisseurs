# The Final Cut  
*A definitive standard for writing NOUS questions*  

> **Mission:** write prompts that slice straight through a player’s assumptions—without ever showing the knife.

## 0 · Core Doctrine – “The Invisible Scalpel”

A NOUS card **fails** the instant the player realises they are analysing wording.  
The prompt must feel like a single, ordinary utterance.  
When the answer is revealed, the player should gasp *“Oh… I read that the other way!”*—not *“Clever grammar trick.”*

## 1 · Six-Gate Ranking System

Evaluate every draft **in order**.  
A “No / Yes” response fixes the **maximum rank** for the card.

| Gate | Question | If failed → ceiling | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **1** | *Is the ambiguity inside the prompt itself?* | **Rank ≤ 2** (Trivia quiz) | If the twist lives in the answer list, you’re testing recall, not perception. |
| **2** | *Is the prompt a single unbroken utterance?* | **Rank ≤ 3** (Crutch) | A two-part setup (“X said… What did X mean?”) advertises the puzzle. |
| **3** | *Do two answers remain simultaneously correct under different readings?* | **Rank ≤ 3** (One-solution riddle) | If only one answer is truly right, it’s just a trick question. |
| **4** | *Is the ambiguity merely a simple pun / synonym swap?* | **Rank ≤ 3** (Pun quiz) | Wordplay alone ≠ hidden contract; it tests vocabulary. |
| **5** | *Does choosing A vs B expose a **cognitive dichotomy** (literal vs metaphor, social vs physical, etc.)?* | **Rank ≤ 4** (Clever but shallow) | Without a worldview fork, the card teaches nothing about the player. |
| **6** | *Does the prompt feel natural—yet secretly exploits a conversational “invisible contract”?* | **Rank 5** (Perfect Cut) | The player thinks they’re answering a mundane query… until the mirror snaps. |

## 2 · Failure Modes & How to Fix Them

| Failure type | Symptom | Surgical fix |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| **Trivia Trap** | Ambiguity in answer list | Relocate ambiguity into prompt wording. |
| **Crutch** | Separate analysis question | Fuse the explanation into the same sentence or drop it. |
| **One-Answer Riddle** | Only one answer works | Craft a second, frame-dependent truth. |
| **Pun-and-Done** | Depends on homonym | Add a contextual frame so each meaning implies a different reality stance. |
| **Shallow Fork** | Answers expose knowledge, not worldview | Embed a moral / epistemic choice (e.g., comfort vs precision). |

## 3 · Quick Pattern Cookbook (when you’re stuck)

| Pattern | Micro-example (not full card) |
|---------|------------------------------|
| **Quantifier Scope** | “Everyone loves *someone*.” — Who is loved? |
| **Instrument vs Ownership** | “She painted the wall **with Maria’s brush**.” — Whose brush is dirty now? |
| **Time Reference** | “The deadline moved **forward two days**.” — Earlier or later? |
| **Inclusive vs Exclusive** | “Which doors are **open**?” (≥ open vs = open) |
| **Moral vs Literal** | “When is a promise broken?” — On utterance vs on failure |

Each pattern can pass all six gates if executed as a single, seamless prompt.

## 4 · Author Checklist (pin at your desk)

- [ ] Prompt and question are the **same sentence**.  
- [ ] Two interpretations survive first-pass reading.  
- [ ] Wrong answer is **tempting** but eliminable under both frames.  
- [ ] No wording that hints “spot the ambiguity.”  
- [ ] Picking Typical or Revelatory maps to a worldview axis.  
- [ ] Self-test on fresh reader: do they debate which of two answers is “obvious”?

## 5 · Final Reminder

> **Stop testing knowledge. Start testing perception.**  
> The best NOUS question is a mirror that only appears **after** the player has already revealed themselves.
