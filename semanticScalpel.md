*A manifesto for writing NOUS questions that cut, not quiz.*

## 0 · The Operating Metaphor

> **The linguistic trick is not the puzzle—it’s the scalpel.**  
> A NOUS prompt uses that scalpel to split two worldviews and asks the player which shade of meaning they value.

If the “aha” moment is merely “I spotted the pun,” the question has failed.  
The true “aha” is: **“I had to reveal my bias.”**

## 1 · Three-Step Surgical Method

| Step | What you do | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Find the Fracture Point** | Identify a *real* ambiguity—lexical, syntactic, zeugma, garden-path, paraprosdokian, donkey sentence. | This is the blade that will open two readings. |
| **2. Set the Dichotomy** | Frame a prompt that forces the player to side with **Lens A** or **Lens B**.<br>Common dichotomies:<br>• Social vs Physical<br>• Metaphorical vs Literal<br>• Systemic vs Individual<br>• Functional vs Factual | The cut is only meaningful if it exposes a philosophical choice. |
| **3. Write Answers as Worldviews** | **Typical** = instinctive lens.<br>**Revelatory** = counter-lens using same words.<br>**Wrong** = plausible miss that ignores the fracture. | Players aren’t identifying grammar—they’re declaring allegiance. |

## 2 · Fast Reference: Types of Scalpels

| Ambiguity | Mini-definition | Tiny example |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Lexical** | One word, many senses | *bank* (money / river) |
| **Syntactic** | Two valid parse trees | “I saw the man *with the telescope*.” |
| **Zeugma / Syllepsis** | One verb, two realms | “He **took** his hat and his leave.” |
| **Garden-Path** | Expectation reverses mid-sentence | “The old man the boats.” |
| **Paraprosdokian** | Final clause repivots meaning | “Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.” |
| **Donkey Sentence** | Pronoun reference puzzle | “Every farmer who owns a donkey feeds *it*.” |

## 3 · Checklist Before You Call It “NOUS”

1. **Does the prompt stand alone?** No setup paragraphs.  
2. **Can you explain *both* correct answers in ≤ 20 words each?**  
3. **Would two smart people honestly disagree before the reveal?**  
4. **Is the Wrong answer still attractive?**  
5. **Which dichotomy is being tested?** (Write it in the card comment.)

## 4 · Mini-Workshop (Annotated)

> **Prompt:** “What did the room notice was gone?”  
> *(from the zeugma line “He took his hat and his leave.”)*  
> **Typical (Social Lens):** His presence.  
> **Revelatory (Physical Lens):** His hat.  
> **Wrong:** Nothing—it was empty.  

*Fracture Point:* zeugma on **took**.  
*Dichotomy:* Social vs Physical absence.  
*Result:* Answers reveal whether the group personifies the room or thinks literally.

## 5 · Writer’s Litmus

If your draft question cannot pass this one-line paraphrase:

> “The player must choose which *kind* of meaning to defend.”

…then sharpen the blade or choose a new fracture point.

### Closing Slice

> **We don’t test knowledge. We expose the hand that holds the knife.**

Keep the edge clean.
