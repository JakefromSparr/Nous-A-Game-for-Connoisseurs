# Nous-A-Game-for-Connoisseurs
A haunted trivia experience where players work together or fall apart
**Nous** is a social, experiential game played by a group acting as a single mind. Inspired by *Ouija*, *Barnum psychology*, and *personality tests*, it uses trivia not as a test of knowledge—but as a mirror. Every answer you give tells it something. About you. About your group. About what you’re hiding from yourselves.

A haunted, single‑mind trivia prototype built with **Vite** + vanilla JS.
Three physical (or on‑screen) buttons.

This is not a tool.
