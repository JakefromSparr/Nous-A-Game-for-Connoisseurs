*A unified standard for writing NOUS questions that cut, not quiz.*

---

## 0) The Point

NOUS questions aren’t trivia. They expose **why** people assume, not **what** they know. 

A NOUS card fails the instant the player realizes they’re analyzing wording. The prompt must feel like a normal utterance. The “aha” is not “clever grammar trick,” but:
**“Oh… I read that the other way — and that reveals something about me.”**

**One-line litmus:**

> “The player must choose which *kind* of meaning to defend.” 

---

## 1) The Three-Step Method 

### Step 1 — Find the Fracture Point 

Identify a *real* ambiguity inside the prompt itself (not in the answer list). Examples: lexical, syntactic, zeugma/syllepsis, garden-path, paraprosdokian, donkey sentence. 

If the twist lives in the answers, you’re writing a trivia trap. 

### Step 2 — Set the Dichotomy (the cut)

Frame the prompt so the ambiguity forces a **worldview fork** (Lens A vs Lens B). Common forks:

* Literal vs metaphorical
* Social vs physical
* Systemic vs individual
* Functional vs factual
* Comfort vs precision

### Step 3 — Write Answers as Worldviews 

Every question has three answers: **Typical, Revelatory, Wrong.** 

* **Typical** = instinctive/default reading (safe/common lens)
* **Revelatory** = counter-reading that is *also correct* under a different interpretation
* **Wrong** = tempting miss that collapses under both interpretations

**Non-negotiable:** Two answers must remain simultaneously correct under different readings. If only one is truly right, it’s a trick riddle, not NOUS. 

---

## 2) Answer Classes (Design Contract)

### What the player experiences

* **Typical**: “Sure, that’s what it means.”
* **Revelatory**: “Oh. That’s also true. I just didn’t choose that lens.”
* **Wrong**: “That *felt* plausible… why did I want it to be true?”

### Scoring & Thread (engine behavior reference)

* Typical: **+2 points**, **+0 thread**
* Revelatory: **+1 point**, **+1 thread**
* Wrong: **+0 points**, **−1 thread**

---

## 3) Categories (Mind / Body / Soul)

Each card belongs to exactly one category (even if it *touches* others).

* **Mind** — structure, language, logic, semantics
* **Body** — physical reality, constraints, sensory/factual limits
* **Soul** — meaning, intent, ethics, emotional truth

---

## 4) The Six Gates (Quality Rubric)

Run every draft through these **in order**. 

1. **Ambiguity lives inside the prompt** (not the answers).
2. **Prompt is a single unbroken utterance** (no setup paragraph, no “X said…”).
3. **Two answers are simultaneously correct** under different readings.
4. **Not merely a simple pun/synonym swap.**
5. **Choosing Typical vs Revelatory exposes a cognitive dichotomy** (worldview fork).
6. **Feels natural while exploiting an “invisible contract”** of conversation.

---

## 5) Failure Modes (and surgical fixes)

* **Trivia Trap**: the cleverness is in answer options

  * Fix: move ambiguity into the prompt wording. 
* **Crutch Setup**: “X said… what did they mean?” telegraphs the puzzle

  * Fix: compress into one utterance or discard. 
* **One-Answer Riddle**: only one answer is truly right

  * Fix: craft a second truth that survives under an alternate parse/frame. 
* **Pun-and-Done**: depends on homonym recognition

  * Fix: embed context so each meaning implies a different stance on reality.
* **Shallow Fork**: reveals knowledge, not worldview

  * Fix: sharpen the dichotomy (comfort vs precision, social vs physical, etc.).

---

## 6) Pattern Cookbook (when you’re stuck)

Use at least one pattern. Tier 5 often blends two.

High-yield patterns:

* **Scope / Context ambiguity** (“birthday,” “side”) 
* **Quantifier scope** (“Everyone loves someone.”) 
* **Instrument vs ownership** (“with Maria’s brush”) 
* **Time reference** (“moved forward two days”) 
* **Gricean implicature** (violating conversational “invisible contract”)
* **Zeugma / syllepsis** (“took his hat and his leave”) 
* **Garden-path / expectation flip** 
* **Myth vs mechanism** 

---

## 7) Rating Scale (1–5) — “How clean is the cut?”

Rate the *craft quality* of the card, independent of tier.

* **1** Pun/riddle, no implicature tension
* **2** Mild twist; still obvious
* **3** Good idea; framing fuzzy
* **4** Strong; minor ambiguity remaining
* **5** Two valid interpretations, crystal framing, genuine reflection

---

## 8) Tier Taxonomy (0–5) — “What kind of experience is this?”

Tier is about *intent + player feeling*, not just difficulty. (Tier 0 is tutorial.)

| Tier | Name                 | Right-answer pattern                           | Player feeling                     |
| ---: | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
|    0 | **Invitation**       | 3/3 “works”                                    | onboarding, trust-building         |
|    1 | **Classic Cut**      | 2 of 3                                         | “bias revealed”                    |
|    2 | **Moral Compass**    | 2 of 3 (values)                                | “it’s about us now”                |
|    3 | **Scholar’s Gambit** | 2 of 3 (jargon vs folk / precision vs comfort) | “am I smart or gullible?”          |
|    4 | **Unfair Game**      | 1 of 3                                         | “the mirror is cheating”           |
|    5 | **Shattered Mirror** | 0 of 3 (projection)                            | “we’re exposed; nothing is stable” |

## 9) Submission Checklist (single, non-overlapping)

A draft isn’t “NOUS-ready” until all are true:

* [ ] **Prompt stands alone** (no setup paragraph).
* [ ] **Ambiguity is inside the prompt**, not smuggled into answers. 
* [ ] **Two answers are correct** under different readings; **one wrong** under both.
* [ ] You can explain **both correct rationales** in **≤ 20–30 words each**.
* [ ] Wrong answer is **tempting** (not a throwaway).
* [ ] You can name the **dichotomy** being tested (write it in a comment).
* [ ] Assigned **category** (Mind/Body/Soul) and at least one **pattern**. 
* [ ] Rated **1–5**; Tier 3+ generally expects rating **≥4**.

## 10) Closing Reminder

Stop testing knowledge. Start testing perception.

> “We don’t test knowledge. We expose the hand that holds the knife.”
